# Proposed Methodology
This folder contains the code, models, plots, results, and data splits for XDR-Net (our proposed method).
Subfolders:
- `code/`: notebooks or .py scripts for training/inference
- `models/`: checkpoints (use Git LFS if pushing to GitHub)
- `plots/`: figures (ROC, confusion matrices, Grad-CAM)
- `results/`: prediction CSVs, metrics tables
- `splits/`: train/val CSVs used in experiments
