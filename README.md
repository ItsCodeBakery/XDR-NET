# XDR-Net: Explainable Hybrid CNN→Token-Attention for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

**One-line:** A lightweight, explainable DR grader that couples an EfficientNet backbone with a single self-attention bridge, delivering strong performance and clear Grad-CAM evidence on APTOS 2019.

---

##  Overview

Automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening demands models that are **accurate, efficient, and transparent**. Pure CNNs capture local lesion cues (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates) but can miss **global retinal context**; attention models capture global relations but are often heavy. **XDR-Net** balances both: it keeps EfficientNet’s compact convolutional features and adds a single token-level self-attention block before pooling. We pair this with a pragmatic training recipe for imbalanced grades and clinician-oriented visual explanations.

## Preprocessing (APTOS 2019)

We apply a reproducible, screening-oriented preprocessing pipeline:

- Circular crop of the fundus and background removal  
- Resize to **384×384**, per-channel standardization  
- **CLAHE** on luminance to enhance local lesion contrast while limiting noise

## 🏗Proposed Methodology (XDR-Net)

**Backbone:** EfficientNet (from `timm`) for compact, high-quality feature extraction  
**Token-Attention bridge:** a **single Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA)** applied on the final feature map (tokenized) to inject **global retinal context** with minimal overhead  
**Head:** Global Average Pooling → LayerNorm → Dropout → Linear (320→5) for 5-class DR grading  
**Training/Inference:** AdamW (cosine schedule), class-weighted CE with label smoothing; test-time augmentation and temperature scaling for calibrated probabilities  
**Explainability:** Grad-CAM on the last conv block; class-wise grids and error panels

## Explainability

We generate class-discriminative **Grad-CAM** overlays from the final convolutional block, enabling graders to visualize lesion evidence and failure modes.
